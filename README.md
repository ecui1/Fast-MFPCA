# Fast-MFPCA
This project provides supplementary materials for the paper, Fast Multilevel Functional Principal Component Analysis.
- The proposed method is implemented in the function mfpca.face();
- An exmple to run mfpca.face() is shown in the file demo.R;
- The R markdown file in the fold Rmarkdown provides two examples on the time difference between traditional MFPCA and fast MFPCA under different sizes of the simulated data. It would help understand the proposed method.
